=======================================================================================================================

This library helps users to build web-applications that support concurrent editing of documents from different
devices. It is used, for instance, in a retail environment to allow sales staff to be able to collaborate on
on orders. The same order can be edited from two or more iPads/iPods/iPhones at the same time.

In order to keep the learning curve low, the library integrates with
[<img src="http://backbonejs.org/docs/images/favicon.ico" /> backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) and assumes that
a library such as [<img src="http://socket.io/images/favicon.ico" /> socket.io](http://socket.io/) is used to
connect the diffent users.
